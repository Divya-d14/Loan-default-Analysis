# Loan default Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a basic understanding of **risk analytics** in the banking and financial services domain. The primary objective is to leverage data to minimize the risk of financial loss while lending to customers. By analyzing various factors that contribute to loan defaults, this project aims to provide actionable insights to improve risk assessment strategies and enable proactive default prevention measures.

     - Credit score

2. **Analyze Financial Attributes**:
   - Investigate correlations between:
     - Upfront charges
     - Loan amount
     - Interest rates
     - Property values

3. **Identify Patterns and Insights**:
   - Examine data trends to identify patterns linked to default tendencies.
   - Develop insights to inform lending practices and reduce risks.

4. **Enhance Risk Assessment Strategies**:
   - Provide recommendations for more informed lending decisions.
   - Propose proactive measures to mitigate default risks.
